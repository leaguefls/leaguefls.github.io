Morning all,

I signed off yesterday’s post by posing that this GW would be a cracker, and it certainly hasn’t disappointed, though I’m certain a host of managers won’t be sharing in my mirth.

THE PROTAGONISTS

Saturday’s tie against an out of sorts QPR witnessed a devastating return to form for the impressive Miguel Michu. A brace coupled with an assist for Pablo Hernandez’ goal saw the former Rayo Vallecano man manage a 15 point pre-bonus haul, catapulting him straight back into the managerial reckoning (for the 2 who do not have him anyway).
Gareth Bale plundered the points in the early kick-off, providing a barnstorming display to put a tepid Newcastle side to the sword at Shite Hart Lane. A brace was enough to leave managers ruing their lack of faith in the Welshman, a regret evidenced by the fact that all of the managers missed out on his 12 point pre-bonus haul.

Other big hitters upfront included Pablo Hernandez, Eden Hazard and Santi Cazorla. Rickie Lambert stole the show in Southampton’s incredible win over the champions, chipping in with a couple of assists whereas Huth, Mariappa and Angel Rangel bagged the points in defense, each providing a goal. Cesar Azpilicueta shone as well, picking up a couple of assists. Clean sheets proved a rare commodity, earned only by Mark Schwarzer and Wojciech Szczesny on the back of superb performances.

IMPLICATIONS

As stated above, the rollercoaster that was yesterday’s fixture list has had massive ramifications on the fortunes of our league. For the first time since it commenced, Andrew Orina has been displaced by the rampaging Benchwarmers FC manager Onesmus. He can’t say it wasn’t coming, as a slew of below par performances from him over recent GWs coupled with a resurgence in Ones’s form had made the outcome inevitable. It would also add to his ignominy that this coup has served as well-earned comeuppance for Orina who’s running tirade of insults and overall hubris had had the rest of the league vexed to no end. Nevertheless, the GW is far from decided and whereas Benteke could provide the differential Oris craves for, Ones should remain confident that his decision to captain Michu has him assured of a greater stead.

Further afield, Allan Kisanya will be left questioning City’s 
defensive resolve as his 3 City assets fell to a 3-1 defeat. 0 points for Clichy and a mere 2 for the pricey Hart will certainly pose more questions than answers. Another dismal return in defense was the case for the lower end of the league with most managers having invested in QPR defensive assets. Checheso’s Allan Anyona will be left scratching his noggin after a combined 2 pt haul from all of Julio Cesar, Ben Davies and Chris Samba; though captaining Michu does save a bit of grace. The villain of the piece, Destroyer 05’s Denis Korir, who went into the GW facing a 20 (TWENTY) point hit has to contend with a meagre 13 points from 7 players as well as the piercing pain of not having Michu, some effort!

A special mention for two other gaffers. Sheila of Django FC who will 
be left smarting after a punt gone bad saw her go into the GW without a goalkeeper. I [had](http://leaguefls.wordpress.com/2013/02/09/gameweek-27-frisking-the-squads/) mentioned that her first choice Tremmel was a rotation risk (and so it proved, with Michel Vorm thrust straight back in after returning from injury) and her other GK Radek Cerny isn’t even in the QPR squad! Add to this an 8 point hit, the threat of USB Eindhoven going past her and not having Michu, it promises to be quite damp indeed. Al Shaababian manager Ben's starting XI proved to be the stars of day 1, amassing a 55 point haul from 7 players in an inspired showing which featured amongst others a clean sheet, 4 assists and 3 goals.

Till tomorrow. Arrivederci.
