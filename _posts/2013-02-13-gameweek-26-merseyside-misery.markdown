An abridged version for this afternoon,

Liverpool falter at Anfield to further deepen managerial frustrations. Steve Clarke’s resurgent Albion side spoilt the party as they came tops thanks to late goals from Gareth Mc Auley and substitue Romelu Lukaku in a 2-0 victory. Steven Gerrard’s failure to convert a penalty early on after Luis Suarez was felled in the area signaled the start of a long evening for managers. And so it came to be that the big hitters drew blanks, considerably denting managers’ hopes of the DGW materializing into a points bonanza.

RAMIFICATIONS

The team sheets confirmed as much as had been predicted. Suarez, Gerrard, Johnson, Jose Enrique, Agger and Henderson all started. The big surprise however was Daniel Sturridge whose thigh injury kept him out of contention, a big blow to the gaffers who had drafted him in (not least those who had gone so far as making him captain). 

As stated above, few could have predicted the result, a notion evidenced by the fact that Albion players enjoyed very sparse ownership in the League of Failures. Debutant Eric Muiruri of The Baddest United was the only manager left to enjoy the spoils as he reaped a 15 point post-bonus haul from Gareth Mc Auley. And it was pretty much it to be honest. 

The second half of the DGW beckons. 

Arrivederci,
