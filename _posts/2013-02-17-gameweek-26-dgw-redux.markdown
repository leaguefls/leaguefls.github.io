Better late than never, 

TEAM NEWS
 
Swansea offer the bulk of the headlines this evening as Micheal Laudrup fields a weakened team, his thoughts on next week's Capital One Cup final against Bradford, perchance. 

Swansea XI: Vorm, Tiendalli, Monk, Bartley, Davies, Britton, Agustien, de Guzman, Lamah, Shechter, Hernandez. SUBS: Tremmel, Williams, Michu, Routledge, Dyer, Moore, Rangel. 

Liverpool are rather more pragmatic, Brendan Rodgers presenting arguably his strongest possible side. Two eye-catching inclusions being Daniel Sturridge, who managed to shake off a thigh strain that kept him out of contention last week, and full-debutant Phillippe Coutinho.
 
Liverpool XI: Reina, Johnson, Carragher, Agger, Jose Enrique, Downing, Gerrard, Lucas, Coutinho, Suarez, Sturridge. SUBS: Gulacsi, Henderson, Allen, Borini, Sterling, Shelvey, Skrtel. 

25 minutes in, the knives are drawn for this one. Will managers who captained Michu rue Laudrup's reckoning or will the Suarez brigade have the last laugh? 

It couldn't be better poised.
