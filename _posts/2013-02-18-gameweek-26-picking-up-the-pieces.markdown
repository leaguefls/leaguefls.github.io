The Reds pick off a hapless Swansea in a five goal mauling courtesy of imperious showings from Luis Suarez, Daniel Sturridge as well as Jose Enrique, who shone at both ends of the field. A result that rounded the DGW off impeccably as managers who kept faith with Liverpool assets welcomed their rewards. 

THE PROTAGONISTS

As mentioned previously, Liverpool and Swansea were the only sides to feature in the weekend in a re-arranged feature - the result of Swansea progressing into the final of the Capital One Cup final. This had a considerable bearing on the weekend game as it were. Swansea boss Micheal Laudrup brought out a weakened team, choosing to rest a few of their big hitters. Most notable here was talisman Miguel Michu, who had amassed a post-bonus haul of 18 points in the previous week. This of course meant that managers with the Spaniard had to settle for him playing a single game rather than the two that the DGW implied.  As such, Swansea’s performance was indicative of that of a patched-up second-string side. They were outrun in every possible department by a rampant Liverpool. Brendan Rodgers handed starts to Daniel Sturridge, Jamie Carragher and debutant Phillippe Coutinho. They did not disappoint, Sturridge shone, reaping ten points from his goal and assist. Luis Suarez ran the rule; a classy goal as well as two assists saw him accrue 16 points - a healthy coup for the many who handed him the armband. New boy Coutinho, who comes in at 6.5 on FPL, will have managerial eyebrows raised to his fledgling potential. A clean sheet saw Liverpool defensive assets reap healthy returns as well.

IMPLICATIONS

The standout performer of the week remains Al Shabaabian gaffer Ben. A near-perfect 110 point return saw him destroy the record book as he smashed the 96 point marker he had set earlier in the season. He eclipsed Kisanya as he ensconced himself into the lucrative top 6 places for the first time this term. Not far back was 5amFC’s Sammy Goin, who garnered a barnstorming 102 points.  A terrific return that sees him etch his signature into the LoF record books. Khasoko FC’s 94 points were only enough to nab him third spot in the week’s rankings - a testament to this week’s strong form. 

Further afield, Andrew Orina showed resurgent form to stave off a stiff challenge from Benchwarmers gaffer Ones. He had [shown](https://twitter.com/Orisdrew/status/302663828871729153) considerable apprehension earlier in the week as regards Ones’s form but his result would be enough to assuage any initial concerns. Ones will be looking at what could have been as he mulls over the ensuing 10 point gap. Daggymnyama’s Douglas Odipo will most certainly be left smarting over a terrible gameweek as he ponders a lowly 54 point return - just over half as many points as those at the zenith of the leaderboard.

TALKING POINTS 

With the double gameweek practically over, sights will be set on offloading Liverpool and Swansea assets with the view of dodging the blanks both team present next week. We should expect investment in Manchester United assets as they look to ascertain their dominance at the top of the log with the title in sight. Rafael and Jonny Evans present budget options into a United defence which we would expect to get meaner by the game. Newcastle’s midfield looks a decent source of points as well as Moussa Sissoko and Cabaye continue to master the Magpies ascend up the table. A keen eye will also be cast towards the returning Hatem Ben Arfa. 

That’s all for today folks,

Arrivederci,
