Evening gents and lady,

Only a few minutes remain until the commencement of the penultimate game of what has been an odd gameweek, really. With none of the big-boys to call upon (Liverpool v Tottenham is hardly super-Sunday fare, if you follow my drift), gaffers (the ones who bothered that is) have been forced to rummage far and wide in amongst the relative bleakness of the lower reaches of the league table in the search for fantasy points. As expected, in the face of great peril and adversity, most managers in the LoF did what any seasoned fantasy football hack would do when under the cosh - absolutely nothing. 

The direct result of this is that only a handful of managers were left to plunder the points. Topmost among these is Al Shabaabian gaffer Ben who extended his fine fettle with a plentiful haul of 31 points from 7 - enough to propel him to the rarefied air of the top 7000-worldwide bracket. A plush investment in Norwich defensive assets paid off as the Canaries were able to muster strong clean sheet points along their backline, affording him strong returns from ‘keeper Mark Bunn, Russell Martin and Michael Turner. Upfront Michu and Benteke provided the goods. Sessegon drew a blank from his fixture against QPR, though you sense he won’t be worried about that – especially given he still has Bale, Sissoko and Suarez yet to feature. Benchwarmers FC is never far away from the zenith and yesterday was no different, considerable attacking returns from Michu, Lukaku and Snodgrass rounded off a tasty 21 point haul for manager Ones. It remains to be seen whether he makes up further ground on league leader Andrew Joseph Orina - who this week attempted, rather embarrassingly, to sing a [hymn](https://mobile.twitter.com/Orisdrew/status/310613716959907841?p=v).

The other big news of the day saw a new member take to the marbled halls of the League of Failures. Eric Njagi, rogue barrister turned hooligan football fan (or is it the other way round? heavens), joins, rather bereft of credibility in these here streets but with more than enough experience and wits. A fellow crusader, I did indeed partake in  battle against him and his class team many a times in years yonder. I bid him and ergo his Locomotives FC side the best of luck.

It’s Newcastle vs Stoke City and Tottenham vs Liverpool.

Arrivederci,
