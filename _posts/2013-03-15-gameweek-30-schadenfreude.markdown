The thirtieth gameweek of the season beckons and with it, an opportunity to lean back and take stock of the week that was. Gameweek 29 had it all – a new pope (habemus papam!), our pioneer [millennialist](http://fantasy.premierleague.com/my-leagues/538486/standings/) and more-than-a-few dodgy tears from a Deputy President-elect (politics, eh?). It wasn’t all smooth going though, as most managers were caught pants down by the barrage that is fantasy football. A cursory glance at the league log reveals that Khasoko FC and Al Shabaabian ran the rule by some distance as they extended their fine fettle. Al Shabaabian in particular is looking the part as the fantasy season chugs ever so slowly to a quite tantalizing finale. 

THE NUMBERS

1,021 – Andrew Joseph Orina’s total points tally since the 2012/2013 fantasy league season started. Ergo he becomes the first player to join the rarefied air of the millenarian pantheon. Since the league commenced many moons ago, he has remained bivouacked alone at the summit throughout, lofty heights that have remained unmatched thus far. While this is merit enough for a bit of pride, he should best be warned not to rest easy on his laurels. 

17 – the total number of players in the League of Failures following the addition of newest entrant, Lower Saxony’s  Fabian Ntabo. A hearty begrüßung, herr Ntabo. Here’s hoping he eschews the curse of the debutant and goes on to register a strong showing on the board.

14 – the number of points Allan Kisanya’s Clash of the Titans could muster in gameweek 29. Fellow managers have watched with many a furrowed brow as a former doyen of the game edged perilously down the league standings. Accustomed to a regular seat at the pantheon, Kisanya’s recent form has been anything but impressive as a string of below par offerings culminated in last week’s dour 14 point return. 

THE WEEKEND DIGEST 

An abridged version this evening,

Following the limited offerings of last week, gaffers will undoubtedly be spoilt for choice with ten fixtures available to pick from. Manchester United v Reading is definitely the tie of the weekend as far as fantasy reckoning goes. United with the league all but sewn up entertain a wounded Reading, reeling from the unprecedented sacking of Brian McDermott. Managers will be hoping Robin van Persie runs riot and repays the great faith that most definitely be accorded to him. Swansea v Arsenal is another dicey contender gaffers will no doubt be casting their fantasy nets towards. 

Oh, do have a gander over at FFS for their [scout picks](http://www.fantasyfootballscout.co.uk/2013/03/15/scout-picks-gameweek-30/).

It’s up for grabs,
