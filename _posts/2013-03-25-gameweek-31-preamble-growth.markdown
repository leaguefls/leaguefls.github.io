Evening, 

It’s been a busy weekend at LoF HQ despite the lack of the Premiership football. Not one, but two new managers have sauntered across the balsa wood floors over to our registration desk – The Cool Kids and Blacks FC with their managers’ [@shokashugi22](https://twitter.com/Shokashugi22) and Ezy Jones respectively. As ever, it is in our remit to provide the strongest competition on the land and as such a boost in numbers fits in perfectly with our mantra. 

CHECHESO’S PICKS

Ever the arch-proposer of avant-garde nostrums, Checheso boss Allan Anyona has been at his brilliant best yet again. This time he emerges from the thinking chamber after a brief conclave, bearing with him a newfangled scheme in his never-ending quest for fantasy league domination. Introducing Checheso Picks – Allan Anyona’s be-all and end-all answer to [Fantasy Football Scout’s](http://fantasyfootballscout.co.uk) ‘botched’ (as he persistently alleges) scout picks. Ergo, the new segment begins this weekend with clairvoyant extraordinaire Anyona set to reveal his picks this Friday. 

INTERLULL IMPLICATIONS 

Theo Walcott’s banjaxed. A whole host of other players remain at risk of the same as they take to the pitch in their national colours.

That’s that. 

Arriverderci,
