Winter is here. So is Premiership football and its allied bustle as millions scutter over to the fantasy football page in zomibified unity. It’s a potentially cathartic affair for most, certainly for myself, after the write-off that was the erstwhile gameweek - as managers wield the proverbial axe on their squads, culling the deadwood and performing the arduous task that is rotation. This, I would imagine would be markedly easier for some more than others. Allow me to lessen this quandary somewhat as I shed light on a few points of note that have boggled the psyche.

**To RvP or not to RvP**

When it comes to bones of contention I dare say you’ll struggle to find ones chewier than the Dutchman’s case. While there is little that can be questioned of van Persie’s fantasy league peerage, his recent league form has gone some way in sowing a seed of doubt in many a seasoned gaffer’s mind. Questions abound as to whether retaining the prolific striker remains an iron-clad requisite, certainly as it was in the halcyon period not so long ago. Or indeed whether it makes better sense to look for value elsewhere, this especially with the proliferation of budget striking options (the likes of Christian Benteke, Rickie Lambert and Dimitar Berbatov spring to thought) whose form better van Persie’s at the moment. As ever, the seminal factors must be kept in close consideration when exploring this conundrum. The Dutchman has on umpteen occasions throughout the season proven his credentials as an explosive hitman, so much so that he has only recently been ousted by Luis Suarez(more on him later) in the race for the capocannoniere. The league title is all but wrapped up for United, pragmatically speaking, but it would be folly to expect a lowering in standards under Sir Alex Ferguson’s behest. It makes sense to reckon that, still smarting from last season’s letdown, Sir Alex would be well within his wits to demand even extra from his players. The existential concern remains - would this manifest in RvP getting more minutes on the pitch to afford him a greater chance of bagging the golden boot? Or would this mean additional game time for the backup brigade (Hernandez et al; perhaps so as to satisfy Premier League medal [requirements](//www.premierleague.com/en-gb/fans/faqs/minimum-games-played-in-order-to-win-league-medal.html”))?. 

**Luis Suarez**

Love him or hate him (many do, and with great vim), you cannot escape him. Whether he’s turning on the heat on your contenders in your mini-league or splitting your hairs with his sporadic profligacy or his knack for picking up inexplicable bookings – there’s always plenty of column inches when it comes to El Pistolero. While many Liverpool supporters were licking their lips at the addition of Daniel Sturridge to their ranks in January, the chief beneficiary has rather strangely been a man whose powers many had thought would diminish given the prospect of having to share attacking duties which were previously his individual ambit. It has come to pass that whereas Sturridge has languished from injury to injury, the Uruguayan has been banging in the goals for Liverpool. Even so, Suarez’ owners are no strangers to his vexatious ways. Case in point, while Suarez sits steady atop the goalscoring charts at the moment (and stands a chance to cement that position further when Liverpool take on strugglers Aston Villa), he also leads the way in the suspension stakes – he is one booking away from amassing 10 yellow cards and thus suffering the automatic suspension that this singular achievement entails. Yay or nay? You decide.

If on the off-chance you are still reading this (incredibly unlikely) then I bid you tribute for wading on through this superfluous diatribe. 

That’s that, then.

May the force be with you.


Edit: I should probably point out that I rarely, if ever, edit these pieces and if I do, it occurs after a period upon which any amendments, however necessary, are rendered trite.
