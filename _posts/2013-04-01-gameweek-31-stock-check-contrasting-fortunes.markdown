The aggregator beeps as it processes the figures, its underbelly groaning gutturally in perpetual dissatisfaction, crunching number after painstaking number. The concerned parties watch on, their countenances etched in angst. The machine grounds to a sudden halt, it's loud din reduced to a steady hum. Asphyxiating smoke dissipates across the room. The results dribble from the machine’s belly, first as slow ooze then as a cantering stream. This is fantasy football.

RESULTS (PROVISIONAL)

Provisional yes, as Fulham-QPR is yet to transpire - not exactly a potential goal-fest, or so I hope (though I’m certain Douglas Odipo will be hoping otherwise). 

Its honours even at the summit as Al Shabaabian and USB Eindhoven share the (provisional) bragging rights – tied on 75 points. Ben will be hoping to cement the top spot outright as he awaits returns from Juilo Cesar – needless to say, Dennis Kigen will be decidedly contrary. On this form the rest of the league should have enough cause for concern about this pair. Ben’s form in particular has stood the test of time (and opposition litanies). With his keen eye for the differential (Vertongen ffs!) and a fine streak of luck, it remains to be seen how the man from Texas fares on in his push for the European places as the league draws to a close.

In second place is Daggymnyama’s Douglas Odipo who for the third week running continues to denounce his doubters. His is a curious case though. Concerns had been raised as regards his wanting form in the days gone by – many had questioned his level of application, leading to allegations of him not pulling his weight had been levelled his way. These concerns vanished somewhat circa gameweek 30 (coincidentally or otherwise, this was when we established the money league) when his form about-turned and he hasn’t look back since. 

Sammy Goin comes in a close third – he continues his measured rise into mid-table. Closing off the top four positions is league leader Andrew Orina with 63 points. He continues his mulish stay at the top of the league, having opened up a 21 point gap between him and Benchwarmers FC. 

On the other side of the points divide, it was an exacting welcome to life in the fantasy lane for a few of our new boys. Ezy Jones’ Blacks could only muster 28 (no worse than Peter Bahati’s 25, mind) as Konshens’ Swag teem drew 37 points. [@shokashugi22](http://twitter.com/shokashugi22) showed his pedigree to some degree with a 46 point haul. Elsewhere, matters continued to hot up in the Money League. At the moment, it seems like a two Llama race between USB Eindhoven and Daggymnyama. Eindhoven sit on 75 with everyone having featured, barring a pending auto-sub in defence (which should amount to an extra 1 point by the current projections). Daggymnyama sits pretty on 67 points with the added caveat being that he awaits points from in-form marksman Dimitar Berbatov as well as goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer.

So there we go, come on QPR! et cetera.

Veni, vidi, vici,
