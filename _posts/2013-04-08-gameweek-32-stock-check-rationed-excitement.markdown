It’s an hour and a bit to the definitive game of the gameweek as Manchester United vs Manchester City lock horns in what’s bound to be a classic. A quick gander at the points table thus far reveals a fair few themes of interest. Andrew Orina cemented his first place position with a strong 48 point return, further dampening Benchwarmers FC’s hopes – he extends his margin over second place to 40 points. Orina will be among a cohort of managers anticipating a healthy return from off-colour Dutchman Robin van Persie. Further afield, Allan Anyona registers 45 points, placing him in 2nd place and well In the running for as appertains the splinter money league. Checheso’s picks, under the moniker of The Picks, comes in 3rd and is seemingly set to assuage early concerns over his relatively dour form (considering the FFS picks as the operative yardstick). Tied on 40 points are a whole host of gaffers – Al Shabaabian’s Saddam Saad, Invincible XI’s Alex Baraka and the very impressive debut performance of newcomer Daniel Rogony.
