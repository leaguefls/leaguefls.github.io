Evening gaffers,

There’s only one gameweek left before we get to the penultimate round of fixtures and as the end of the line draws increasingly closer, DGW 36 emerges from the embers, roseate and beaming. Plenty remains unsettled in the LoF, and as such the DGW offers gaffers a most welcome opportunity to try their hands at gaining an edge here or indeed fashioning an upset there. I’ll get right into it as I try and separate fact from fiction in this most compelling of juggernauts that is fantasy football.

THE TEMPLATE IS BACK 

Fads always come and go. It’s not too long ago when gaffers near-unanimously disbanded the so-called midfield template that had carried most through the bulk of the season that semblances of the same have begun to reappear. The template is back, emphatic and in-your-face, like it never left. Its composition however, save for a few familiar cogs, has been the subject of some change. Goal-a-game-man Gareth Bale leads the way as he continues to discount his doubters each passing week courtesy of his fine fettle. A run of form which most recently led the Welshman to receive the Football Writers’ Association Player of the Year, PFA Player of the Year as well as the PFA Young Player of the Year awards. Needless to say, if you do not have Bale in your side by now, you might as well switch over to playing checkers or some other less mentally-demanding fare. Theo Walcott stakes his claim next, alongside his former Southampton teammate. The Arsenal man is now on 20 goals this season and currently ranks among the hottest fantasy prospects. A winner against Rangers yesterday coupled with a collective lack of form among Arsenal’s other forwards only serves to increase Walcott’s appeal. Next up in the template is a familiar face in Chelsea’s Juan Mata. A relative security of starts as well as imperial attacking prowess sets the Spaniard apart in midfield. A goal tonight against Manchester United further reaffirms his return to form. Rounding off the template is a list of mid-price midfielders spanning the entire form gamut. From the precocious Michu to the sizzling Coutinho, gaffers have a wide pool to cast the nets from. Shaun Maloney, in particular, stands out for his scintillating form for the Latics recently as they rally to avoid the drop. 

ANDREW ORINA IS CHAMPION-ELECT

There’s no point denying it now. It’s probably been this season’s worst kept secret. The ribbons were placed early enough when Orina assumed the zenith of the league at the very first week of the LoF’s conception, a position he has duly maintained ever since. In truth it’s been pretty easy going for The Ents save for Onesmus Nderitu’s spirited (but in effect futile) charge towards the end of the season perhaps, a season that’s been a remarkable testament to his transfer market parsimony as well as his all-round managerial savvy.

FOURTH SPOT IS UP FOR GRABS

Not so long ago we were talking up Al Shabaabian gaffer Ben Musa’s fantastic end of season form and with good reason, his form had seen him scale up the league standings well into fourth place. Fast forward now and a perilous flirtation with point hits sees him only 5 points ahead of USB Eindhoven manager Dennis Kigen. Fortunately for both gaffers, they won’t have to wait much further to know their fates as matters are likely to be decided this gameweek. 

That’s that for now,
