The gloves were off for Saturday as managers readied themselves yet again for a dabble at the fantasy juggernaut. The managerial palate was sufficiently sated and breath bated at the prospect of some tantalising weekend clashes. At stake, the potential for points on the board as well as the ever-looming feeling of angst (both being dished in increasingly equal measure these days). To this effect, the weekend did not disappoint as with it came a barrage of points, talking points and all round good football. Notable amongst a plethora of gleanable subplots remains the unabating form of Aaron Ramsey. Not only has the rampaging Welshman been banging in the goals for Arsenal but he has also continued dishing out retributive justice to those who have given him the cold shoulder. Incredible still is that even despite multiple price rises, the midfielder continues to present tremendous value at a mere £6.8m for those on the managerial throes keen on joining the party, even at this late juncture.
    
**Ramifications**

The League of Failures remains largely unchanged save for a dribbling of movement at the top half. Up top, the impressive Reu pipped Onesmus into 1st place, his 65 point haul fashioning a 10 point gap over his nemesis. Die Mannschaft and FC Sirius Black both moved up a notch into 8th and 9th respectively, this at the expense of Cindikate FC and Bazinga FC. Further afield, Dennis Kigen’s Freedom of Tchoyis skedaddled into 12th courtesy of his 64 points. Sheila Minayo’s 41 points could only see her consigned to a drop into 13th. Last week’s marquee mover Joel Drake struggled to replicate that form, dropping into 15th. The picture shall not doubt change come Monday evening given that two fixtures are still yet to be played. Today sees Villa welcoming an indifferent Tottenham, with the likes of Benteke, Soldado and Eriksen expected to play significant roles. Monday sees Fulham make the short trip to Selhurst Park to face Crystal Palace in a match more notable for the fates of the two gaffers than anything else. 

**Sizzling Arsenal** 

Under the aegis of the mesmerizing talents of the mercurial Mesut Özil, Arsenal’s fettle isn’t looking anywhere near burning out. Top of the log and maintaining consistent membership in amongst the goals and assist charts, the Gunners have continued to exhibit championship-winning form all the while presenting a wide array of assets for the fantasy reckoning. With Palace rolling up in the weekend, it is expected that Arsenal assets will continue to enjoy great interest in the fantasy stakes.

**Southampton cannot be ignored**

Hot of earning a great point at Old Trafford, the Saints have continued to show good value for their 4th place standing on the log. Mean in defence, Robin van Persie’s effort was only the first time their backline had been breached in five gameweeks. Adam Lallana and Dejan Lovren remain standout options at either end of the pitch.

That’s that for now then,
