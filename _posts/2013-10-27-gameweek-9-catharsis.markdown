Afternoon LoFers,

It’s slightly over noon as I emerge from the covers, still buoyant and resplendent with the afterglow of fantasy success. As the points total attest, the last two gameweeks (this one most certainly included) have been something of a managerial catharsis, and a timely one at that. The events of gameweek 7 still linger in the psyche, the ignominy of which most are still smarting from. The turbulent wave now appears rode and the fixture list affords decent opportunity for building a head of steam. Nevertheless, as a head as experienced in the sheer unpredictability of fantasy football as my own would know, angst is never far off; more so in the face of such unfettered glee.

**Implications**

Whilst the sands from the gameweek remain far from settled, the LoF picture has seen a raft of movement. The jousting at the very zenith that has characterized the season so far showed no signs of letting up. Last night it was Onesmus Nderitu with the definitive jab, elevating himself to just the point above Herr Reuben. **Excelsia FC’s** 43 points kept him within sight of the front two as his consistent efforts continue to prevent the gap from them furthering. Under the aegis of a rampaging Luis Suarez and with maximum points gleaned from defense, Allan Anyona’s **Mystagogue FC** delivered a sensational 73 point haul. A devastating return as Peter Bahati's **Bison Herd** realized, his team effectively consigned to 6th as a result.

However much the gameweek remains to change, great praise must be lauded to the efforts of Dennis Kigen’s **Freedom of Tchoyis**. While his 60 point haul was not especially spectacular (given what transpired elsewhere), the context in which it arrives offers far greater perspective. Currently 7th, the fact that Dennis has played a gameweek less than everyone else in the top 16 provides a decent metric of the kind of form the fantasy stalwart has been in. What it also reveals is exactly how terribly most LoF managers have fared this term – of notable mention here being the likes of Eric Njagi, Robert Okello and Andrew Orina. It remains to be seen how he saunters on from here on, not least after this gameweek, but what’s certain is that his ascension into the top 10 has set a marker to the rest of the competition.

Plenty remains to be decided as 4 fixtures are still to be played out. The Tyne-Wear derby sees Newcastle trot up to the Stadium of Light to face Gus Poyet’s Sunderland. The highlight of the day no doubt sees Chelsea squaring up against City with the race for the title firmly on the menu. Tottenham accost Hull City and Swansea await the visit of the Hammers.

That’s about the size of it then,


**Addendum**: Here's something I did and thought you might fancy. Word clouds and all that...
