The sands of gameweek 11 are definitively settled and with the interlull arriving, managers are afforded an opportunity to look back and analyse their progress (or lack of) over the last eleven weeks. Often met with palpable scorn and fervent disdain, the interlull is this time warmly welcomed apropos perhaps to the current state of the league.** **

**Reuben Lagat **continues to hold fort up top despite having a shocker last weekend - a curt reminder of the ebb and flow nature of fantasy fortunes. In what has been perhaps the most significant move (positively, at least) since the opening gameweek, **Douglas Odipo** pipped **Onesmus Nderitu **into **2nd** place. This promises to be an interesting battle given that Reu's poor return means the gap between the top three has now been greatly reduced.

**David Chichop **continued to add weight to his maverick status, this time posting a league high 89 points to drive him into **4th**. Up next remain the ever-presents. 5th to 9th place have largely featured the same faces since the start of the campaign. Of these it is Allan Omoga's **Mystagogue FC **and Fabian Ntabo's **Die Mannschaft **who have exhibited probably the greatest constistency. **
**

Further afield and two great rivals adorn subsequent positions on the log. **Saddam Sadd**, of the كرة القدم الحب persuasion, struggling to rediscover his sizzling early season form and Freedom of Tchoyis' **Dennis Kigen,** stuck in a first gear after a spate of good form saw him climb to as far as 7th place. Just below is Sammy Goin's indifferent **BombarderFC.**

Elsewhere, fate conspires to have the league's ladies within touching distance of each other.** **In **13th**, **Sheila Minayo **travails persist as she seeks to make up ground on a leading pack within which she featured not so long ago. In 14th, **Cindikate FC's **Cindy Oronga experiences much the same. Having had to contend with very tetchy recent form, she now has to consider the impending challenge posed by the two managers below her on the log - **Dennis Korir** and** Hillary Egesa**.

For 17th placed **Andrew Orina**, January cannot come soon enough. Recently touted to be on the path to redemption, his efforts at recovery fizzled out no sooner had they began to take shape. Now seemingly rooted to the fantasy nadirs, last season's champion faces a huge battle to ensure that this campaign is not consigned to the throes of failure.

That's that for now then.
