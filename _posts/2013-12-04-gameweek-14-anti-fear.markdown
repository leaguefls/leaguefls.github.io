title: Gameweek 14 – Anti-Fear

Suddenly and shorn of all sense of practicality and timing, gameweek 14 emerges from the (still) burning embers of the weekend. To the optimist, an opportunity to right the wrongs of gameweeks past. To the eternal pessimist (read: me), yet another damp squib – a chance to forge ahead in my increasingly taxing journey into mid-table mediocrity. It hasn’t been that bad, you might argue. But it has. In order to grasp the full picture one only has to hark several moons back into gameweek 9, or easy street as I’d like to remember it. I’d just broken into the rarefied air of the top ten off the back of a relatively big points haul. Such was the bombast at the time that I had already began mooting myself to breach the top three by the next gameweek. Well, that never materialized. In one (not so unexpected) fell swoop, gameweek 10 sauntered along and utterly annihilated everything.

The ill-effects persist to this day as is evidenced by this newfound chagrin with which I operate; a fear of failure. As such, the cold weekends of December shall be spent aiming to rediscover the jammy touch, the freeing sense of youthful abandon, or as **Andrew Orina** would like, searching for [anti-fear](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdHK_r9RXTc).
