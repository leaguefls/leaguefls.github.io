It's probably fitting that  I should post a blog based on a transfer story on deadline day.

Weeks on after the idea was originally mooted, LoF has finally moved from WordPress to the balsa wood halls of GitHub Pages. Why? You might quip. Well it's important to note that it's not because of any failings on WordPress's part. Quite the opposite, WordPress has been an excellent servant for the blog (which turns a year old next week). At the time, it represented my first dabble at blogging and as such I greatly appreciated the (now seemingly) overt obfuscation of the inner workings behind the nice admin interface. Brilliant when all you want to do is post articles at a canter. But what happens then when the databases, comment moderation, bloat and overall lack of control over your content begins to feel exacting and a _bit_ disingenuous?

Enter [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). Jekyll is a simple blog-aware static site generator. It allows you to create content in markdown and manage everything with git. Even cooler is that you can deploy your static files to a special Github Pages repo and within minutes have your site hosted up for (absolutely) free. No ads, no PHP, no databases, no hosting fees and most importantly, it's _uber-cool_.

So yeah, I'm pretty chuffed I finally made the move. And in truth, that's all that really matters. 

Back to the football tomorrow.
