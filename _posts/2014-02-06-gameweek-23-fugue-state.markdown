Gameweek 23 passed on without much kerfuffle for most. On a personal level, however, it might just have been the most significant gameweek thus far in my stuttering campaign. 

Hark back with me to Saturday afternoon as I nonchalantly went about my usual routine. The seminal facts were in my possession - I needed to effect two transfers prior to the deadline in order to eschew the risk of fielding only 9 fit men. The said transfers had already been planned well in advance in the days preceding the deadline. Daniel Sturridge would slot in for the hamstrung Sergio Aguero with Romelu Lukaku giving way to Jay Rodriguez. All that remained was the academic (or so it seemed) task of making the actual moves. 

Fast forward to two-thirty and the dawning of the grim realisation that by some horrendous twist of fate, I had 'forgotten' to do the business. I shall not encumber you with the stark details of the immediate aftermath, you can pretty much fill them in for yourselves, schadenfreudistic bastards. If you're expecting me to trail off into the long story of how I slowly degenerated into debilitating fugue or some other dissociative state... Well, no. That was not to be. Quite the opposite actually. Once the mortal fear of logging in had blown over, I got on only to find a glut of green arrows in wait. Yep, not a softly-worded email from the powers at be at FPL kindly offering to delete my account. Or a cavalcade of red arrows. In my perceived [harmatia](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmatia) I had somehow ended up conjuring a way of banish my rapid descent down the ranks. What's the moral in all this, you might ask. Well, put simply, all of this signals a monumental u-turn in the way I've been playing the game. Enough of poring religiously over fixture lists and scheming transfers months in advance. Long forgotten are my days of trawling through the [hallowed halls](http://www.fantasyfootballscout.co.uk) late into the night soliciting crumbs of advice from equally troubled souls. Sod that. 

This, ladies and gentlemen, is the advent of a new me. A new [casual](http://www.fantasyfootballscout.co.uk/2013/11/22/the-weekend-team-news-107/?hc_page=6#hc_comment_6047391) me.
