Not so long (or far too soon) after the firewalking ensemble that was gameweek 28, gameweek 29 dawns upon us. The narrative is a similar one for gaffers - there’s more hot coal to dance around. Cup competitions, forever the fantasy manager’s bane, have conspired yet again to leave us with a dearth of games to work around. Five scheduled fixtures to be exact. Add to this the impending cavalcade of fixture rearrangements and double gameweeks and the managerial outlook begins to appear pretty tetchy. The immediate focus now switches to turning out a full XI for this weekend. Those canny enough to have read the danger will have stockpiled on free transfers and culled their squads accordingly over the preceding weeks in preparation. Those not so clairvoyant will look to point’s hits to lessen their quandaries; the result of which will no doubt go a long way in shaping the outcome of the next few weeks. 

A few important notes gleaned from the hallowed halls of Fantasy Football Scout:

+ The ‘strong’ over the next few gameweeks: Stoke City, Southampton, Sunderland, Everton.
+ The ‘weak’ over the next few gameweeks: Arsenal, Tottenham, Aston Villa.
+ The watchlist: DEFENCE - Begovic, Shawcross, Speroni, Ward, de Gea, Evra, Foster, Ridgewell, Mannone, Bardsley, Hart, Kompany. MIDFIELD - Hazard, Lallana, Mata, Snodgrass, Brunt, Walters, Yaya Toure, Adam Johnson, Noone, Mirallas. FORWARDS - Sturridge, Suarez, van Persie, Adebayor, Crouch, Hooper, Lukaku, Aguero, Borini.
+ Scout picks from gameweek 29 – Ruddy, Terry, Evra, Fonte, Mata, Lallana, Hazard, Snodgrass, van Persie, Lambert, Eto’o. BENCH – Caulker, Ince, Hooper.

Happy hunting,
