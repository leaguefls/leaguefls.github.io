            Gameweek 26 - The Stock Check Part 2
          </h1>
          <p>Morning all,</p>

<p>The dust settles again as the weekend fixtures give way to the double game week. I’ll delve straight into its permutations.</p>

<p>Marouane Fellaini and Juan Mata draw blanks further increasing furrows on managerial brows. Robin van Persie scored and assisted as Manchester United disposed of an out of sorts Everton side to extend their advantage at the summit of the Premier League. In the early kick-off, Christian Benteke and Charles N’Zogbia were the main protagonists in a terse encounter as Aston Villa held off a late challenge from the Irons to pick up a vital 3 points in their quest for Premier League survival.</p>

<p>The competition continued to hot up as mini-battles remained a constant feature in the League of Failures. Ones’s push for the top gathered pace as Michu’s impressive haul coupled with his decision to captain him saw him garner 81 points. Debutant Khasoko FC’s Amos Sitati run the rule, drawing the weekend’s highest score - 83 points, eclipsing Peter Mbithi’s Bison Herd. Another interesting battle drawing interest in the top half of the table pitted Al Shaababian against Clash of the Titans. Ben’s stellar form carried over into Sunday’s fixtures as his 72 points were enough to pip Allan Kisanya and lay a strong marker to the managers in front. A rare surge in form saw Sammy Goin usurp Checheso as new boy Lost Lawz gaffer Hillary Egesa registered his first points on the board.</p>

<p>As the curtains unfurl for the DGW tonight, managers will be casting a cautious eye towards gameweek 27. Liverpool and Swansea’s blanks will prey on the conscience as they look to offload DGW assets. A loss of defensive form for QPR and blanks for Mata and Fellaini will have gaffers re-assessing their squads as we broaden our nets in the search for fantasy points.</p>
