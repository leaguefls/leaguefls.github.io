            Gameweek 30 Review – Diminishing Returns
          </h1>
          <p>A quick one this morn,</p>

<p>The dust has definitively settled and the curtains drawn on what was a most paradoxical gameweek, if ever. Hindsight is a beautiful thing as ever but the distinct sense of lumpen disappointment evidenced on many a countenance as the final whistle blew still pangs to this moment. Funnel back with me to Friday as managerial knives were sharpened to a tee, form guides studied to no end, transfers plotted meticulously, odds averaged. So satisfied were they in their machinations that some managers elected to save the obligatory free transfer, confident that their armband-holders would emerge the purveyors of the points. Fast-forward Monday and best laid plans lay scuppered, fantasy doyens turned anti-heroes, managers left to rummage through the dirge of blanks.</p>

<p>THE BIG HITTERS</p>

<p>Slim pickings here as the big boys drew blanks. Gareth Bale, Robin van Persie, Luis Suarez, Carlos Tevez and Sergio Aguero, all prime captaincy options, flattered to deceive. van Persie in particular, floundered the most as he huffed and puffed to little avail in a game where the Champions-elect were expected to batter the manager-less Royals. Suarez added to managers’ chagrin by receiving an unwarranted yellow card that only served to dent his already meagre return. </p>

<p><strong>Nacho Monreal</strong> – the former Malaga man extended his run of inspired form as he capped an excellent performance away to Swansea with maximum bonus points as well as a clean sheet. Afforded an opportunity by injury to Kieran Gibbs, the Spaniard opened the scoring late on to open the floodgates - Gervinho’s goal a few minutes later enough to seal the three points for the Gunners. </p>

<p><strong>Eden Hazard</strong> – the Belgian signaled a return to form with a classy finish coupled with an assist for Frank Lampard’s – enough to bag maximum bonus points and re-announce himself to gaffers throughout the fantasy gamut.</p>

<p>Upfront, Aston Villa forward <strong>Andreas Weimman</strong> ran the rule in a nervy encounter against struggling QPR – a goal and assist enough to steal the bonus points. His inconsistency as well as the gaffer’s preference for Christian Benteke upfront in the lone role will serve as a deterrent to his appeal, however.</p>

<p>MOVEMENT </p>

<p>In lieu of the points raised, the league log witnessed considerable movement. The biggest casualty was USB Eindhoven’s Dennis Kigen whose league form about-turned into near-abject derision. An awful 24 point return saw the stalwart fall to 7th position as Django FC, Al Shabaabian and Locomotives FC all careened past him. </p>

<p>Fabian Ntabo registered a strong showing in his first attempt - 53 points put him straight up into 15th place on the LoF standings, 2 points above this week’s best performer - Daggymnyama. Which rolls us neatly on to the next big piece of news.</p>

<p>MONEY LEAGUE  </p>

<p><a href="http://leaguefls.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/moneylg.jpg"><img src="http://leaguefls.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/moneylg.jpg?w=300" alt="money league"></a></p>

<p>There had been ramblings flying about of a possible money league being instituted as a sort of catalyst to raise the competition stakes in the LoF. Checheso gaffer Allan Anyona had mooted the idea earlier and now membership seems to have received a boost somewhat. So yeah, if a bit of cash is the necessary fillip you’ve been waiting for and you feel your interest is sufficiently piqued, forward your inquiries to me. </p>

<p>That’s that then. </p>

<p>Be Champions,</p>
