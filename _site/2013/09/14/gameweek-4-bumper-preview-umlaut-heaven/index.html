            Gameweek 4 Bumper Preview - Ümlaut Heaven
          </h1>
          <p>The transfer window is over as is the faff that is the international break and therefore managers can finally bog down and get their heads into what really matters. Piecing apart through the incomings, few strike a louder chord than Arsenal&rsquo;s new midfield recruit. Mesut Özil. Mesut ****ing Özil. Sauntering through the balsa-wood premier league doors, replete with his perma-glow of (undoubted) world class, ready to assist. At the risk of sounding like a broken record, what an utter coup that is, not just for Arsenal but for the League as a whole. Moving on from Özil (reluctantly), there were a fair few other temptation-inducing moves across the Premier League gamut. Finally freed from the shackles of the &lsquo;will-he, wont-he&rsquo; mundaneness of the Bale saga, Spurs set about further bolstering their squad. Dane Christian Eriksen, former Roma winger Erik Lamela and centre-back Vlad Chiriches all joined the fold. Marouane Fellaini joined former boss Moyes at Old Trafford as Romelu Lukaku, James Mc Carthy and Gareth Barry skedaddled over to Goodison Park.  </p>

<p>THE LEAGUE PICTURE</p>

<p>As it stands, Onesmus Nderitu and his Ice Pack side sit pretty atop the log. This courtesy of a league-high 82 point haul from the last round. Lodged at 2nd is relative new boy Reu Lagat&rsquo;s Victoria Concordia. His 66 point score proved enough to maintain matters. Allan Omoga flew into 3rd place, to the great expense of Saddam Sadd and Robert Okello who had to contend with a drop out of the top 3. The big news however remains the raft of delayed entries that the LoF has witnessed this season. Most notable of the omissions was league admin and FPL grand-daddy Dennis Kigen. Kigen, who despite having been mooted as being one of the main title contenders this campaign, was nowhere to be seen on gameweek 1. Naturally, this was a matter which drew plenty of concern around LoF circles. Kigen, however, was quick to assuage matters, revealing that he had &lsquo;intentionally&rsquo; eschewed confirming his squad for the first gameweek. This, he added, was due to a myriad of reasons, most crucial of which was the lack of balance he felt his side was ailing from. He also added, rather to the chagrin of most, that he felt so confident about his own prospects that he didn&rsquo;t mind giving the rest of the league a head start. Informed fact or lazy fiction? It remains to be seen. </p>

<p>WEEKEND PREAMBLE</p>

<p>Casting a fleeting glance at gameweek 4 reveals a whole host of interesting issues.  Not least in the early kickoff pitting the champions up against Crystal Palace. Robin van Persie is expected to run riot, this following a relatively dry patch in front of goal in the Premier League. Squeaky bum time early on then for those without the mercurial Dutchman in their sides. Elsewhere, the 3 o&#39;clock kickoffs have out-of-sorts Sunderland entertaining Arsenal at the Stadium of Light. Owners of Mesut Özil will be sweating over his fitness after reports revealed he missed training with a bout of illness. He has however travelled with the rest of the team, unlike Per Mertesacker who misses out. Fulham face West Brom on the back of Baggies manager Steve Clarke claiming his side were looking to avenge last season&rsquo;s home defeat at the hands of the Cottagers. He is expected to hand starts to new signings Stephane Sessegnon and Victor Anichebe. Further afield, Hull Tigers face Cardiff in the battle of the promoted sides as Villa come up against Newcastle United. Stoke await the visit of Manchester City with the Citizens smarting over their recent poor showing against  Cardiff. Spurs round off the afternoon ties with a home game against Norwich City where all the attention will no doubt be fixed on the fortunes of Andre Villas Boas and his new signings.</p>

<p>Later on in the piece, a late kickoff sees Everton entertaining Chelsea with both sides expected to hand starts to a host of new recruits. Roberto Martinez is due to hand starts to Gareth Barry and James Mc Carthy while Romelu Lukaku is contractually ineligible. Mourinho is expected to introduce Willian and Samuel Eto&#39;o as well. Sunday sees West Ham travelling up to Southampton in the early fixture whereas Liverpool journey to Wales to face Swansea in the late kickoff. </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s that then. (Proper) Football&rsquo;s back. Sit back, relax and have a dig at the opposition dugout while you&rsquo;re at it. </p>
