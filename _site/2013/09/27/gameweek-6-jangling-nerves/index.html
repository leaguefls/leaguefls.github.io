            Gameweek 6 - Jangling Nerves
          </h1>
          <p>Afternoon folks,</p>

<p>Gameweek 6 beckons, and with it the inevitable jangling of managerial nerves as gaffers look to tune and tinker their elevens. Injuries to key players continues to be the overriding theme with a whole host of fantasy stalwarts having to contend with periods on the sidelines. Upfront, doubts still linger over Robin van Persie’s availability for United’s clash against West Brom with the Dutchman looking to shake off a groin strain. In midfield, Aaron Ramsey is expected to recover from a thigh niggle in time for Arsenal’s journey to Swansea. Theo Walcott remains sidelined for “realistically five weeks” according to his manager while Mathieu Flamini set to shake off a small shoulder complaint. There is also concern over the availability of Hull City’s Robbie Brady following doubts indicating that the popular midfield pick might require surgery to resolve a hernia problem. </p>

<p><strong>Suarez returns</strong>
With the Uruguayan having served a 10 match ban, Luis Suarez returns to the Liverpool fold for the match against Sunderland. Having got 90 minutes of action under his belt in midweek, Suarez walks straight back into a Liverpool side suffering injuries to key players. Coming in at £10.9m, he offers a different proposition to managers looking to seal holes left by the likes of <strong>Christian Benteke</strong> and possibly <strong>Robin van Persie</strong>. Injury to creative cog Philippe Coutinho means that Suarez will likely slot in just behind the in-form <strong>Daniel Sturridge</strong> with the pair expected to rekindle the fruitful partnership they showed last season.</p>

<p><strong>Lukaku in the reckoning</strong>
With several of the mid-price forward brigade faltering this season, the emergence of Romelu Lukaku could just be the tonic managers have been seeking thus far. Impacting immediately with a goal as a second half substitute against West Ham, the hirsute Belgian afforded managers a brief reminder of his capabilities. Despite facing competition from the likes of Nikica Jelavic and Arouna Kone, Lukaku’s form makes him an automatic pick for Everton’s Monday showdown against Newcastle. </p>

<p><strong>Michu looms</strong>
Despite having struggled in the earlier weeks of the season, Michu looks to have rekindled the sort of form that made him a devastating prospect last season. A run of three goals in three games coupled with a kind fixture list (beyond this weekend’s visit of Arsenal, anyway) sets the Spaniard high on the list of midfield offerings alongside the likes of <strong>Mesut Özil</strong>, <strong>Aaron Ramsey</strong> and <strong>Christian Eriksen</strong>. </p>

<p><strong>Addendum</strong> 
The Fantasy Football Scout <a href="http://www.fantasyfootballscout.co.uk/2013/09/27/scout-picks-gameweek-6-2/">scout picks</a> for Gameweek 6 are out. The unavailability of Sergio Aguero, Theo Walcott, Christian Benteke and potentially Robin van Persie ultimately decides matters as the Scout attempts to seek out able replacements.</p>

<p><strong>Boruc 
    Baines - Vidic - Kompany - Wilson
             Michu - Özil - Moses
       Lambert - Rooney - Negredo</strong></p>

<p>Backup brigade: <strong>Riether, Arnautovic, Lukaku</strong></p>
