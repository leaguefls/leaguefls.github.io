            Gameweek 10 - Abberation
          </h1>
          <p>It’s a pain that only the most seasoned of fantasy football campaigners would resonate with enough to comprehend. The narrative is a well told one across the fantasy fold - riding high off of the fervent buzz of a winning game week only to be utterly and completely annihilated by the sickening crash of failure. Looking back on the events immediately preceding this aberration, I struggle to envisage a different outcome. I had set myself up for failure really by failing to act. The decision to casually ignore Sergio Aguero’s effervescent form looms large in the memory, as does the faux confidence borne off of handing Romelu Lukaku the armband.</p>

<p>The distant feeling of angst that I had <a href="http://leaguefls.wordpress.com/2013/10/27/gameweek-9-catharsis/">predicted</a> (eerily) now prevails as I stare back at the computer monitor. The output, unchanging, stares back taciturnly. 37 measly points gleaned, I chuckle. That’s nearly the same tally Aguero managed.</p>

<p><strong>Implications</strong></p>

<p>NB: It would probably serve me better to churn out an abridged version here, if only to gloss over my (and others) managerial blushes.</p>

<p>Up top, <strong>Reuben Lagat</strong> continued to exact his superiority, this time his impressive efforts resulting in a substantial widening of the gap between him and chaser <strong>Onesmus</strong>. His 91 point haul, streets ahead of all and sundry, only just another feather in a steadily growing cap. An unabating spate of consistently fine form which he attributes, rather interestingly, to a recent conversion to Buddhism. Make of it what you will.</p>

<p>Down to 2nd place Onesmus managed 40 points, only just enough to keep Douglas Odipo’s <strong>Excelsia FC</strong> at bay. While <strong>Fabian Ntabo’s</strong> 44 points were not especially spectacular, they facilitated a rise in position above <strong>Allan Omoga</strong> (who got 41). Kevin Adhaya of <strong>Bazinga FC</strong> rose above <strong>Saddam Sadd</strong> and <strong>yours truly</strong>, both for whom the less said the better. Further afield, <strong>Andrew Orina</strong> set sail to his revival campaign, helping himself to a healthy 60 points and a rise into 14th place. Other risers were <strong>Lost Lawz’s</strong> Hillary Egesa and <strong>Allan Kisanya</strong> of Royal Pains.</p>

<p>The stage is set then for gameweek 11 as the League of Failures begins to take shape. The events of the gameweek past will no doubt alter the reckoning of most as the jousting for positions intensifies.</p>

<p>I bid fair welcome (as is the norm) to our newest entrant, Robert Chelule and his <strong>Didge FC</strong> outfit, fresh-faced and unaware of the trials and tribulations that await him. This, my friend, is fantasy football.</p>

<p>Arrivederci,</p>
