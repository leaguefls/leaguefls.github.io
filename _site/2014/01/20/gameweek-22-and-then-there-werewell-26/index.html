            Gameweek 22 - And Then There Were…Erm, 26.
          </h1>
          <p>It had seemed for an eternity that if I was ever going to free myself from the asphyxiating shackles of writer’s block, the motivation would have had to be a pretty darn good one. And so it has been. I’m not one to give in to sentiment but it does bring a whiff of quiet pride to see the LoF managerial numbers on the up again. Three recent additions means that the LoF now boasts a whopping 26 gaffers. About those - it’s not just a case of your average run-of-the-mill manager, quite the opposite. Vamperoh, Timgooner and Edmanager all represent significantly good additions to the overall competitiveness of the league.</p>

<p>Here’s a smattering of thoughts…</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>The template is back - </strong>There’s no point acting contrarian about it and feigning faux disgust. The template, motored forward by the marauding full-back foraging of Seamus Coleman, is back. While it’s composition is still uncertain, a fair few familiar faces stand out. At the back, Mertesacker stands tall alongside a gaggle of budget picks from sides battling it out in the bottom half of the table – Ward, Burner, Gabbidon and Chester to name a few. In midfield you&rsquo;d struggle to find a midfield of note devoid of the likes of Eden Hazard, Mesut Ozil, Adam Lallana and Yaya Toure (casual&rsquo;s delight). Up front it&rsquo;s business as usual with the explosive potential of Luis Suarez flanked by the precocious Romelu Lukaku and/or Sergio Aguero. It remains to be seen how much the picture changes over the coming weeks in the face of the January wildcard.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Top ten hotting up -</strong> While few have managed to ascend into the rarefied airs of the top ten, there&rsquo;s no shortage of tales about those who&rsquo;ve fallen by the wayside – if only as a metric of just how tight the competition has become. Up top, the top four continue to set the bar, seamlessly interchanging positions between themselves with the cushion of a 60 point gap from the chasing pack. At 6th place, a mini-battle continues to wage on between Football Love and Bang Average with either seeking to consolidate a place within touching distance of the top.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Everton welcome an embattled Pepe Mel-ful, Anelka quenelle-less West Brom for the final fixture of gameweek 22 this evening. On show, a glut of fantasy protagonists who most gaffers will be hoping deliver the goods to round off a decent week of points scoring. Over to you messrs Coleman and Romelu Lukaku (sans signature dreadlocks).</p>
