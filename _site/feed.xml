        <title>Gameweek 23 - Pyrrhic Victory</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;With the transfer window definitively shut yesterday, the focus returns to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobius_strip&quot;&gt;mobius strip&lt;/a&gt; that is premier league football. Much as I would love to (I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t) delve into how your club has fared over the window, I&amp;rsquo;d be best served to leave that to the good eggs over at &lt;a href=&quot;http://fantasyfootballscout.co.uk&quot;&gt;fantasy football scout&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scene is set with gaffers squinting through their Saturday hangovers trying to make sense of the cavalcade of injuries that underline this gameweek. It&amp;rsquo;s a tetchy situation indeed with most having already expended their January wildcards and now having to contend with possibly incurring hits to assuage matters. Add to that the added tumult brought about by new signings and it quickly becomes a not-so-nice problem to have. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my case, the last few weeks have been something of a pyrrhic victory. My calls for increased competitiveness in the league were met by three new additions (four now with Wamae FC being the latest entrant). As regards the competition stakes, this was obviously good for the LoF - three of the new boys are already firmly ensconced within the top 6. From a personal perspective however, doubts linger over whether this was a move draped with folly. For all of the benefit served up by having the new chaps dominating the higher echelons, you have to wonder how detrimental that proves to the existing camaraderie. You see, LoF is very much a &amp;lsquo;family&amp;rsquo; league. Most of us are good mates coming from a shared background. The original motivation for its formation was the desire to compete with each other as such. It was all hunky dory at the start when the idea was still novel but as is normal with most things, the initial lustre faded somewhat with quite a few of the original pack losing interest. Case in point the likes of Ben (who&amp;rsquo;s on something of a self-imposed Mugabe Media Lockdown), Allan Kisanya and Alex Baraka. The concern remains, does the addition of new &amp;lsquo;unknowns&amp;rsquo; and their subsequent ascension to the top only serve to further exacerbate an already ailing situation? Is it more disheartening to log on and find that you&amp;rsquo;ve been bundled back five places by folks you don&amp;rsquo;t know who perhaps don&amp;rsquo;t share your same level of attachment or enthusiasm for the entire shebang? These are questions whose answers will likely emerge as the season continues to run its course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll leave you to mull over that.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Gameweek 23 - Movement</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s probably fitting that  I should post a blog based on a transfer story on deadline day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weeks on after the idea was originally mooted, LoF has finally moved from WordPress to the balsa wood halls of GitHub Pages. Why? You might quip. Well it&amp;rsquo;s important to note that it&amp;rsquo;s not because of any failings on WordPress&amp;rsquo;s part. Quite the opposite, WordPress has been an excellent servant for the blog (which turns a year old next week). At the time, it represented my first dabble at blogging and as such I greatly appreciated the (now seemingly) overt obfuscation of the inner workings behind the nice admin interface. Brilliant when all you want to do is post articles at a canter. But what happens then when the databases, comment moderation, bloat and overall lack of control over your content begins to feel exacting and a &lt;em&gt;bit&lt;/em&gt; disingenuous?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;. Jekyll is a simple blog-aware static site generator. It allows you to create content in markdown and manage everything with git. Even cooler is that you can deploy your static files to a special Github Pages repo and within minutes have your site hosted up for (absolutely) free. No ads, no PHP, no databases, no hosting fees and most importantly, it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;uber-cool&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty chuffed I finally made the move. And in truth, that&amp;rsquo;s all that really matters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to the football tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Gameweek 22 - And Then There Were…Erm, 26.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It had seemed for an eternity that if I was ever going to free myself from the asphyxiating shackles of writer’s block, the motivation would have had to be a pretty darn good one. And so it has been. I’m not one to give in to sentiment but it does bring a whiff of quiet pride to see the LoF managerial numbers on the up again. Three recent additions means that the LoF now boasts a whopping 26 gaffers. About those - it’s not just a case of your average run-of-the-mill manager, quite the opposite. Vamperoh, Timgooner and Edmanager all represent significantly good additions to the overall competitiveness of the league.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a smattering of thoughts…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The template is back - &lt;/strong&gt;There’s no point acting contrarian about it and feigning faux disgust. The template, motored forward by the marauding full-back foraging of Seamus Coleman, is back. While it’s composition is still uncertain, a fair few familiar faces stand out. At the back, Mertesacker stands tall alongside a gaggle of budget picks from sides battling it out in the bottom half of the table – Ward, Burner, Gabbidon and Chester to name a few. In midfield you&amp;rsquo;d struggle to find a midfield of note devoid of the likes of Eden Hazard, Mesut Ozil, Adam Lallana and Yaya Toure (casual&amp;rsquo;s delight). Up front it&amp;rsquo;s business as usual with the explosive potential of Luis Suarez flanked by the precocious Romelu Lukaku and/or Sergio Aguero. It remains to be seen how much the picture changes over the coming weeks in the face of the January wildcard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top ten hotting up -&lt;/strong&gt; While few have managed to ascend into the rarefied airs of the top ten, there&amp;rsquo;s no shortage of tales about those who&amp;rsquo;ve fallen by the wayside – if only as a metric of just how tight the competition has become. Up top, the top four continue to set the bar, seamlessly interchanging positions between themselves with the cushion of a 60 point gap from the chasing pack. At 6th place, a mini-battle continues to wage on between Football Love and Bang Average with either seeking to consolidate a place within touching distance of the top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everton welcome an embattled Pepe Mel-ful, Anelka quenelle-less West Brom for the final fixture of gameweek 22 this evening. On show, a glut of fantasy protagonists who most gaffers will be hoping deliver the goods to round off a decent week of points scoring. Over to you messrs Coleman and Romelu Lukaku (sans signature dreadlocks).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Gameweek 17 - Ticking Over</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A quick gander at the log following the first instalment of this gameweek reveals a fair few patterns. First off, if you still have doubts over whether Luis Suarez is essential to this exercise then I best suggest you seek other softer, less mentally taxing fare. Embattled Cardiff rolled up to Anfield for the first encounter of the weekend to face a buoyant Liverpool side still buzzing off of their triumphs at the Lane a week before. Suarez, seemingly unperturbed by the collective weight of millions of armbands, set about destroying the Bluebirds rearguard with great guile and panache. Ably aided by the rampaging Raheem Sterling and Jordan Henderson, the Uruguayan notched two sublime goals and an assist to ensure a 3-1 win for the Reds, enough to take them to the summit of the log - if only until Monday when Arsenal and Chelsea square off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the mass angst experienced the week before from not doing so, it was pretty much a given that gaffers would hand Suarez the armband. While this meant that it was even par across the gamut, several managers still gained ground with other differentials. Yaya Toure, in particular, seems to have a cult following amongst the top ten. Wayne Rooney chipped in with two assists to assuage the worries of owners who had stuck with him despite great doubts beforehand about whether or not he would feature against West Ham. In between the sticks Mignolet continued to frustrate owners as he conceded yet again. Whether their inability to keep it clean at the back dents his appeal in goal remains to be seen. Up top, matters remain largely undecided with Giroud, Lambert and Lukaku still to play a part. The middle of the park sees a whole host of differentials yet to play their part with the general pattern being a smattering of Arsenal, Chelsea, Everton and Southampton midfielders. Significant as well remains the fact that plenty of gaffers elected to take points hits to furnish their transfer business this gameweek – how much of a factor that will end up being remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Gameweek 14 – Anti-Fear</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Suddenly and shorn of all sense of practicality and timing, gameweek 14 emerges from the (still) burning embers of the weekend. To the optimist, an opportunity to right the wrongs of gameweeks past. To the eternal pessimist (read: me), yet another damp squib – a chance to forge ahead in my increasingly taxing journey into mid-table mediocrity. It hasn’t been that bad, you might argue. But it has. In order to grasp the full picture one only has to hark several moons back into gameweek 9, or easy street as I’d like to remember it. I’d just broken into the rarefied air of the top ten off the back of a relatively big points haul. Such was the bombast at the time that I had already began mooting myself to breach the top three by the next gameweek. Well, that never materialized. In one (not so unexpected) fell swoop, gameweek 10 sauntered along and utterly annihilated everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ill-effects persist to this day as is evidenced by this newfound chagrin with which I operate; a fear of failure. As such, the cold weekends of December shall be spent aiming to rediscover the jammy touch, the freeing sense of youthful abandon, or as &lt;strong&gt;Andrew Orina&lt;/strong&gt; would like, searching for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdHK_r9RXTc&quot;&gt;anti-fear&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Gameweek 12 - Rapprochement</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, not quite. Rancor, more like. In any case, the resumption of the Premier League juggernaut following an arduously long interlull meant that managers were back to their calculating best. The stage, grandly set, lived up to its immense billing with goals featuring high up on the menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst the league picture remains largely unchanged, there were some significant benefactors from the weekend’s goal scoring exploits. &lt;strong&gt;Andrew Orina&lt;/strong&gt; took advantage of an 82 point haul to climb into 13th place and more significantly, within 30 points off the top 10. A welcome turn in fortune for the fantasy doyen who had dwelt in the lower reaches for far too long this term. Up top, &lt;strong&gt;Reuben&lt;/strong&gt; continues to exact dominance - his 66 points saw him consolidate 1st place, opening up a 35 point gap on the rest of the pack. 1st place aside, the other positions on the log remain perilously uncertain as managers remain separated by the smallest of margins. Case in point – 9th through to 20th all lie within the 500-600 point range. Where’s a DGW when you need one, eh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A few musings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Renaissance men&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gameweek 12 was over and above a weekend for forwards doing what they love most – banging in the goals. While Suarez and Aguero notching was hardly news, the return to goal scoring form for a few forwards whose stars had began fading would have had gaffers chirping and cursing (if you’d just sold ‘em, that is) as well. Romelu Lukaku, Olivier Giroud and Shane Long all served up the goods with their braces serving as reminders of how patience can pay off in the managerial stakes. Whilst their resurgence might be dented somewhat by the continuing returns from their more expensive counterparts (Rooney, Suarez and Aguero), what it does provide is food for thought for those on a budget looking to get in on the party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;City imperious at home&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Man United, Norwich and more recently, Tottenham, found out, Man City at the Etihad are a different kettle of fish. Having notched seven without reply past Norwich earlier in the month, City took all of 15 seconds to breach a mean Spurs defense that had conceded only 6 league goals all season. What sets City apart from most is their ability to turn the screw and exact dominance over their opponent when winning. And that’s just what they did – helping themselves to a 6-0 victory over a clueless, hapless Tottenham outfit. With a few of their fellow title hopefuls rolling up to the Etihad over the next month, it remains to be seen whether they can maintain their swashbuckling home fettle.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Gameweek 11 - As We Stand</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The sands of gameweek 11 are definitively settled and with the interlull arriving, managers are afforded an opportunity to look back and analyse their progress (or lack of) over the last eleven weeks. Often met with palpable scorn and fervent disdain, the interlull is this time warmly welcomed apropos perhaps to the current state of the league.** **&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reuben Lagat &lt;/strong&gt;continues to hold fort up top despite having a shocker last weekend - a curt reminder of the ebb and flow nature of fantasy fortunes. In what has been perhaps the most significant move (positively, at least) since the opening gameweek, &lt;strong&gt;Douglas Odipo&lt;/strong&gt; pipped &lt;strong&gt;Onesmus Nderitu &lt;/strong&gt;into &lt;strong&gt;2nd&lt;/strong&gt; place. This promises to be an interesting battle given that Reu&amp;rsquo;s poor return means the gap between the top three has now been greatly reduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Chichop &lt;/strong&gt;continued to add weight to his maverick status, this time posting a league high 89 points to drive him into &lt;strong&gt;4th&lt;/strong&gt;. Up next remain the ever-presents. 5th to 9th place have largely featured the same faces since the start of the campaign. Of these it is Allan Omoga&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Mystagogue FC &lt;/strong&gt;and Fabian Ntabo&amp;#39;s &lt;strong&gt;Die Mannschaft &lt;/strong&gt;who have exhibited probably the greatest constistency. **
**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further afield and two great rivals adorn subsequent positions on the log. &lt;strong&gt;Saddam Sadd&lt;/strong&gt;, of the كرة القدم الحب persuasion, struggling to rediscover his sizzling early season form and Freedom of Tchoyis&amp;#39; &lt;strong&gt;Dennis Kigen,&lt;/strong&gt; stuck in a first gear after a spate of good form saw him climb to as far as 7th place. Just below is Sammy Goin&amp;rsquo;s indifferent &lt;strong&gt;BombarderFC.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, fate conspires to have the league&amp;rsquo;s ladies within touching distance of each other.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;13th&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Sheila Minayo &lt;/strong&gt;travails persist as she seeks to make up ground on a leading pack within which she featured not so long ago. In 14th, &lt;strong&gt;Cindikate FC&amp;#39;s &lt;/strong&gt;Cindy Oronga experiences much the same. Having had to contend with very tetchy recent form, she now has to consider the impending challenge posed by the two managers below her on the log - &lt;strong&gt;Dennis Korir&lt;/strong&gt; and&lt;strong&gt; Hillary Egesa&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For 17th placed &lt;strong&gt;Andrew Orina&lt;/strong&gt;, January cannot come soon enough. Recently touted to be on the path to redemption, his efforts at recovery fizzled out no sooner had they began to take shape. Now seemingly rooted to the fantasy nadirs, last season&amp;rsquo;s champion faces a huge battle to ensure that this campaign is not consigned to the throes of failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s that for now then.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Gameweek 10 - Abberation</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s a pain that only the most seasoned of fantasy football campaigners would resonate with enough to comprehend. The narrative is a well told one across the fantasy fold - riding high off of the fervent buzz of a winning game week only to be utterly and completely annihilated by the sickening crash of failure. Looking back on the events immediately preceding this aberration, I struggle to envisage a different outcome. I had set myself up for failure really by failing to act. The decision to casually ignore Sergio Aguero’s effervescent form looms large in the memory, as does the faux confidence borne off of handing Romelu Lukaku the armband.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The distant feeling of angst that I had &lt;a href=&quot;http://leaguefls.wordpress.com/2013/10/27/gameweek-9-catharsis/&quot;&gt;predicted&lt;/a&gt; (eerily) now prevails as I stare back at the computer monitor. The output, unchanging, stares back taciturnly. 37 measly points gleaned, I chuckle. That’s nearly the same tally Aguero managed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NB: It would probably serve me better to churn out an abridged version here, if only to gloss over my (and others) managerial blushes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up top, &lt;strong&gt;Reuben Lagat&lt;/strong&gt; continued to exact his superiority, this time his impressive efforts resulting in a substantial widening of the gap between him and chaser &lt;strong&gt;Onesmus&lt;/strong&gt;. His 91 point haul, streets ahead of all and sundry, only just another feather in a steadily growing cap. An unabating spate of consistently fine form which he attributes, rather interestingly, to a recent conversion to Buddhism. Make of it what you will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Down to 2nd place Onesmus managed 40 points, only just enough to keep Douglas Odipo’s &lt;strong&gt;Excelsia FC&lt;/strong&gt; at bay. While &lt;strong&gt;Fabian Ntabo’s&lt;/strong&gt; 44 points were not especially spectacular, they facilitated a rise in position above &lt;strong&gt;Allan Omoga&lt;/strong&gt; (who got 41). Kevin Adhaya of &lt;strong&gt;Bazinga FC&lt;/strong&gt; rose above &lt;strong&gt;Saddam Sadd&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;yours truly&lt;/strong&gt;, both for whom the less said the better. Further afield, &lt;strong&gt;Andrew Orina&lt;/strong&gt; set sail to his revival campaign, helping himself to a healthy 60 points and a rise into 14th place. Other risers were &lt;strong&gt;Lost Lawz’s&lt;/strong&gt; Hillary Egesa and &lt;strong&gt;Allan Kisanya&lt;/strong&gt; of Royal Pains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stage is set then for gameweek 11 as the League of Failures begins to take shape. The events of the gameweek past will no doubt alter the reckoning of most as the jousting for positions intensifies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bid fair welcome (as is the norm) to our newest entrant, Robert Chelule and his &lt;strong&gt;Didge FC&lt;/strong&gt; outfit, fresh-faced and unaware of the trials and tribulations that await him. This, my friend, is fantasy football.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arrivederci,&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Gameweek 9 – Catharsis</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Afternoon LoFers,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s slightly over noon as I emerge from the covers, still buoyant and resplendent with the afterglow of fantasy success. As the points total attest, the last two gameweeks (this one most certainly included) have been something of a managerial catharsis, and a timely one at that. The events of gameweek 7 still linger in the psyche, the ignominy of which most are still smarting from. The turbulent wave now appears rode and the fixture list affords decent opportunity for building a head of steam. Nevertheless, as a head as experienced in the sheer unpredictability of fantasy football as my own would know, angst is never far off; more so in the face of such unfettered glee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst the sands from the gameweek remain far from settled, the LoF picture has seen a raft of movement. The jousting at the very zenith that has characterized the season so far showed no signs of letting up. Last night it was Onesmus Nderitu with the definitive jab, elevating himself to just the point above Herr Reuben. &lt;strong&gt;Excelsia FC’s&lt;/strong&gt; 43 points kept him within sight of the front two as his consistent efforts continue to prevent the gap from them furthering. Under the aegis of a rampaging Luis Suarez and with maximum points gleaned from defense, Allan Anyona’s &lt;strong&gt;Mystagogue FC&lt;/strong&gt; delivered a sensational 73 point haul. A devastating return as Peter Bahati&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Bison Herd&lt;/strong&gt; realized, his team effectively consigned to 6th as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However much the gameweek remains to change, great praise must be lauded to the efforts of Dennis Kigen’s &lt;strong&gt;Freedom of Tchoyis&lt;/strong&gt;. While his 60 point haul was not especially spectacular (given what transpired elsewhere), the context in which it arrives offers far greater perspective. Currently 7th, the fact that Dennis has played a gameweek less than everyone else in the top 16 provides a decent metric of the kind of form the fantasy stalwart has been in. What it also reveals is exactly how terribly most LoF managers have fared this term – of notable mention here being the likes of Eric Njagi, Robert Okello and Andrew Orina. It remains to be seen how he saunters on from here on, not least after this gameweek, but what’s certain is that his ascension into the top 10 has set a marker to the rest of the competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plenty remains to be decided as 4 fixtures are still to be played out. The Tyne-Wear derby sees Newcastle trot up to the Stadium of Light to face Gus Poyet’s Sunderland. The highlight of the day no doubt sees Chelsea squaring up against City with the race for the title firmly on the menu. Tottenham accost Hull City and Swansea await the visit of the Hammers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s about the size of it then,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Addendum&lt;/strong&gt;: Here&amp;rsquo;s something I did and thought you might fancy. Word clouds and all that&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Gameweek 8 - Partial Retribution</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The gloves were off for Saturday as managers readied themselves yet again for a dabble at the fantasy juggernaut. The managerial palate was sufficiently sated and breath bated at the prospect of some tantalising weekend clashes. At stake, the potential for points on the board as well as the ever-looming feeling of angst (both being dished in increasingly equal measure these days). To this effect, the weekend did not disappoint as with it came a barrage of points, talking points and all round good football. Notable amongst a plethora of gleanable subplots remains the unabating form of Aaron Ramsey. Not only has the rampaging Welshman been banging in the goals for Arsenal but he has also continued dishing out retributive justice to those who have given him the cold shoulder. Incredible still is that even despite multiple price rises, the midfielder continues to present tremendous value at a mere £6.8m for those on the managerial throes keen on joining the party, even at this late juncture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ramifications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The League of Failures remains largely unchanged save for a dribbling of movement at the top half. Up top, the impressive Reu pipped Onesmus into 1st place, his 65 point haul fashioning a 10 point gap over his nemesis. Die Mannschaft and FC Sirius Black both moved up a notch into 8th and 9th respectively, this at the expense of Cindikate FC and Bazinga FC. Further afield, Dennis Kigen’s Freedom of Tchoyis skedaddled into 12th courtesy of his 64 points. Sheila Minayo’s 41 points could only see her consigned to a drop into 13th. Last week’s marquee mover Joel Drake struggled to replicate that form, dropping into 15th. The picture shall not doubt change come Monday evening given that two fixtures are still yet to be played. Today sees Villa welcoming an indifferent Tottenham, with the likes of Benteke, Soldado and Eriksen expected to play significant roles. Monday sees Fulham make the short trip to Selhurst Park to face Crystal Palace in a match more notable for the fates of the two gaffers than anything else. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sizzling Arsenal&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the aegis of the mesmerizing talents of the mercurial Mesut Özil, Arsenal’s fettle isn’t looking anywhere near burning out. Top of the log and maintaining consistent membership in amongst the goals and assist charts, the Gunners have continued to exhibit championship-winning form all the while presenting a wide array of assets for the fantasy reckoning. With Palace rolling up in the weekend, it is expected that Arsenal assets will continue to enjoy great interest in the fantasy stakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Southampton cannot be ignored&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hot of earning a great point at Old Trafford, the Saints have continued to show good value for their 4th place standing on the log. Mean in defence, Robin van Persie’s effort was only the first time their backline had been breached in five gameweeks. Adam Lallana and Dejan Lovren remain standout options at either end of the pitch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s that for now then, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Edit: Post incomplete as I’m off to the football. Editorial privileges and all that&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Addendum: Ended up scoring just the five goals at the football today, Sunday League Ronaldinho and all that…]&lt;/p&gt;
